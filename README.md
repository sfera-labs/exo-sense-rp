# Exo Sense RP

Choose you favorite way of programming your [Exo Sense RP](https://www.sferalabs.cc/product/exo-sense-rp/), the multi-sensor module with a Raspberry Pi RP2040 (Pico) computing core:

## Arduino IDE

Repository: https://github.com/sfera-labs/exo-sense-rp-arduino

Use the simplicity of the Arduino IDE to write your powerful firmware.    
This repo contains the most complete set of utilities and examples for programming Exo Sense RP, as well as advanced functionalities like [Sound Level analysis](https://github.com/sfera-labs/knowledge-base/blob/main/soundeval/equivalent-continuous-sound-level-leq.md) and ready-to-use applications like the [Modbus RTU Slave app](https://github.com/sfera-labs/exo-sense-rp-arduino/tree/master/examples/ExoSenseModbusRtu) to use Exo as a standard Modbus device.

## Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK

Repository: https://github.com/sfera-labs/exo-sense-rp-c

For low level, highly optimized programming and access to all the functionalities of the native Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK.

## MicroPython

Repository: https://github.com/sfera-labs/exo-sense-rp-micropython

The flexibility of the Python language, plus an interactive prompt (the REPL) to execute commands on the fly, optimized to run on microcontrollers.
